Create a complete single-page website for a self-drive car rental business in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu named "Namakkal Self Drive Cars". The website must be built with pure HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid), vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 (via CDN) for perfect mobile-first responsiveness. It has to look stunning and modern on phones first (90% of visitors will be on mobile).

Key Requirements:

- Fully mobile-first, thumb-friendly, fast loading
- Beautiful subtle animations (fade-ins on scroll, hover effects, button pulse) – never overwhelming
- Use Google Fonts “Poppins” and Font Awesome icons
- Color scheme: Deep blue (#0d6efd), white, light gray backgrounds, green accents for WhatsApp, subtle gradients

Content & Sections (single scrollable page with smooth scrolling):

1. Hero Section (full viewport on mobile)
   - Fixed top navbar with your logo on left and Instagram icon link on right
   - Big bold heading: “Namakkal Self Drive Cars”
   - Tagline: “Self Drive | With Driver | Acting Driver | Book from UK & Drive in India”
   - Four green check bullets:
     • Wide range of well-maintained cars
     • 24×7 support & roadside assistance
     • Affordable rates starting ₹3500/day
     • Special service: Book from UK → Pick up in Tamil Nadu
   - Two big green WhatsApp CTA buttons (one fixed at bottom on mobile)
   - Background: beautiful HD image of a car on a scenic Tamil Nadu highway (sunrise/sunset)

2. Services Section (4 cards, 1 column on mobile → 2-4 on desktop)
   Card 1 → Self Drive Cars
   Card 2 → Cars with Driver
   Card 3 → Acting Driver (driver for your own car)
   Card 4 → International Booking (Book from UK/Europe, collect car on arrival in Tamil Nadu) ← highlight this as a unique feature

3. Our Fleet Section
   - Responsive grid/carousel showing 8–10 cars (Swift, Dzire, Ertiga, Innova Crysta, etc.)
   - Each card: HD attractive car photo, model name, starting price, “Book on WhatsApp” button

4. Why Choose Us
   - 6 icons with text (Insurance covered, Unlimited kms option, Clean & sanitised, Instant booking, 24/7 support, Pickup/Drop anywhere in Namakkal)

5. Footer / Final CTA
   - Instagram link: https://www.instagram.com/namakkal.selfdrivecars?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==
   - Two WhatsApp numbers: +91 80565 57212 and +91 87547 16212
   - Big green buttons that open WhatsApp chat with pre-filled message “Hi, I want to book a car in Namakkal…”

Technical Details:
- Logo: include <img src="logo.png" class="logo"> at the top – I will upload my own logo.png later
- All images (hero background, car photos, service icons, travel images) must be high-quality, attractive HD stock photos. Use realistic Indian roads, sunrise/sunset shots, clean modern cars. Generate or suggest beautiful free-to-use images (Unsplash/Pexels style) directly in the code with proper URLs so the site looks premium without me uploading anything except my logo.
- All “Book Now / Enquiry” buttons must open WhatsApp with both numbers in rotation or show both options. Example:
  window.open('https://wa.me/918056557212?text=Hi,%20I%20want%20to%20book%20a%20car%20in%20Namakkal', '_blank')
  and another button for +918754716212
- Add floating WhatsApp widget (bottom-right on desktop, bottom-center on mobile) with both numbers
- Add Instagram follow button/widget in footer
- Use Intersection Observer for fade-in animations when sections scroll into view
- Add subtle parallax effect on hero background
- Make the site extremely fast: use WebP images where possible, lazy loading, minimal JS

Output the complete code in three files:
1. index.html
2. style.css
3. script.js

Make everything production-ready, beautiful, conversion-focused (every section should push users to click WhatsApp), and 100% mobile optimized. Generate all required attractive HD car and travel images directly via URLs so the site looks premium from the first second.
